• Boost query parser: Like DisMax's boost parameter, this query parser lets
you specify a function that is multiplied to another query. The query string
is parsed by the Lucene query parser. Here's an example query:
q={!boost b=log(t_trm_lookups)}t_name:Daydreaming
•
Func query parser: The func query parser
will parse the function and expose it as a query matching all documents and
return the function's output as the score. Here is an example URL snippet:
q={!func}log(t_trm_lookups)&fl=t_trm_lookups,score
•
Frange (function range) query parser: This query parser is similar to the
func query parser, but it also filters documents based on the resulting score
being in a specified range, instead of returning all documents. It takes a l
parameter for the lower bound, a u parameter for the upper bound, and incl
and incu Boolean parameters to specify whether the lower or upper bounds
are inclusive—which they are by default. The parameters are optional, but
you will specify at least one of u or l for meaningful effect. 

Here's an example
URL snippet from its documentation:
fq={!frange l=0 u=2.2}sum(user_ranking,editor_ranking)
